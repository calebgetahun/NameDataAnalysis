This project uses data about [baby names from the US Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html) to answer specific questions 
such as how does the popularity of a name change over time given a range of years or a single year, what are the most popular names by decade/century/year, etc.

This project was coded in Java and is to be thought of as a backend to a tool that would display the information generated to a graphic or chart.
